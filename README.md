## Neural Style Transfer

# Overview
This project implements Neural Style Transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. Neural Style Transfer is a technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another image to create artistic images. The content image provides the structure and objects in the final image, while the style image determines the artistic style applied to the content image.

# Principle 
Neural Style Transfer works by optimizing a generated image to simultaneously match the content features of the content image and the style features of the style image. This optimization is achieved by defining a loss function that balances content loss (Lcontent) and style loss (Lstyle). The content loss measures the difference between the features of the generated image and the content image in a specific layer of the CNN, while the style loss captures the differences in style between the generated image and the style image based on Gram matrices of feature maps.


# Installation

**Clone the repository:**

First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. 

**Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages.


# Usage

**Prepare input images:**

Place the images you want to use for content and style transfer in the input/ directory within the project folder.

**Run style transfer:**

Use the neural_style_transfer.py script to perform style transfer. Specify the paths to your content and style images, as well as the output path for the result.


# Dependencies
This project relies on the following libraries:

**numpy:** For numerical computations and array manipulation.

**matplotlib:** For plotting and visualizing images.

**tensorflow:** Deep learning framework for building and training neural networks.

**keras:** High-level neural network API, used here with TensorFlow backend.

# Technical Description
The neural style transfer algorithm used in this project is based on deep convolutional neural networks. It involves extracting content and style features from the input images using pre-trained models like VGG19. These features are then used to generate a new image that combines the content of one image with the style of another, optimizing a loss function to achieve the desired artistic effect.
